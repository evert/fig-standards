## Introduction

Many PHP frameworks define a PHP persistant object cache with various features.
An object cache is something that may be useful in many parts of an
application, and thus may be injected in quite a bit of subsystems.

Examples of this can be found in the Doctrine source as
Doctrine\_Cache\_Interface, and in The Zend Framework source as
\Zend\Cache\Backend.

Both of these then implement their respective interfaces for various types
of common storage systems, including APC shared memory, memcached and the
filesystem.

When a user wants to use multiple frameworks, they are stuck configuring
multiple systems. In addition, library writers that wish to allow users to
leverage an existing caching layer, are stuck providing yet another
implementation, or providing a range of adapters for each of the frameworks
they wish to support.

To fix this, this document proposes a very simple standard interface.

## The interface

    namespace PSR;

    interface ObjectCache {

        /**
         * Stores a new value in the cache.
         *
         * The key must be provided as a string, the value may be any serializable
         * PHP value.
         *
         * The $ttl represents the time the cache entry is valid for. This value
         * should be treated as advisory, and may be ignored by implementations
         *
         * @param string $key
         * @param mixed $value
         * @param int $ttl
         * @return void
         */
        function set($key, $value, $ttl = null);

        /**
         * Fetches an object from the cache.
         *
         * If the object did not exist, this method must return null.
         *
         * @param string $key
         * @return mixed
         */
        function get($key);

        /**
         * Deletes an item from the cache.
         *
         * @param string $key
         * @return void
         */
        function unset($key);

    }

## Notes

* This document does not define how to handle error conditions, such as the
  inability to store an item, due to for example a backend being down.
* There is no distinction between fetching a 'null' value, or an item not
  existing in the cache backend. It is up to the calling code to work around
  this, if needed.
* This document does not define what constitutes valid keys. Backends may have
  restrictions around this. It is recommended for the calling code to use
  sane keys, and possibly run a hash function if needed.
